\begin{frame}{Renaissance of neural networks -- Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item{ Deep learning's successes can be explained by three factors:
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Advances in computer hardware and software (e.g. GPUs)
      \item Abundance of data
      \item Complex models with massive number of parameters, even if they are unidentifiable and uninterpretable
  \end{enumerate}}
  
  \item
  DNN's success in ASR~\cite{Hinton2012} draws attention in speech research community
  \begin{itemize}
     %\item{INTERSPEECH: 2012=20, 2013=27, 2014=16, 2015=36}
     \item{Outperformed the Gaussian Mixture Models in acoustic modelling}
      \item { Appearance of "deep" keyword in the proceedings of \textbf{ICASSP}-- 2011: \alert{13}, 2012: \alert{18}, 2013*: \alert{61}, 2014: 
      \alert{102}, 2015: \alert{111}, 2016: \alert{149}}

\begin{frame}{DNNs role in speaker recognition (SR)}
  DNNs are employed in two ways in SR
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{Direct} way~\cite{Variani2014}
            \begin{itemize}
              \item{A DNN is trained as a classifier for the intended recognition task directly to discriminate between speakers for SR}
            \end{itemize}
       \item \textbf{Indirect} way~\cite{Yun_Lei2014}
       \begin{itemize}
           \item{A DNN is possibly trained for a different purpose to extract data that is then used to train a secondary classifier for the intended recognition task}
           \item{Extract frame-level features or accumulate multi-modal statistics}
       \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
  
  Most of the exist studies applied DNNs in indirect way. Thus the focus of this presentation is on the same.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%Statistics are accumulated by first estimating the posterior of each GMM component density for a frame
% and using these posteriors as weights for accumulating the statistics for each component of the mixture distribution
% The zeroth order statistics are the total occupancies across an utterance for each GMM component and the
% the first order statistics are the occupancy weighted accumulations of feature vectors for each component.
% The i-vector is then computed using a dimension reducing transformation applied to the stacked first order statistics.

    \item Extract using the same DNN trained for ASR task
    \item A GMM-UBM is trained with BN features to get frame alignments
    \item Have the tendency to suppress the "unimportant" speaker related information

\begin{itemize}
    \item Senones are dependent on language
    \item Need huge amount of computational resources
    \item The recognition performance greatly depends on the data used for training the DNN
